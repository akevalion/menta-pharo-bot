* [/] local development doesn't support public/ 
    + use ngrok? --> annoying: free account creates a new url each time so we should update github app's settings each time
    + set up a sshfs to a huelmo dev-public/? <-------------- WIP
    + set up independent file servers at huelmo for both dev and prod that are always online --> which one?
* [ ] replace hardcoded "../public/" 
    + with an environment variable that can be customized dev/prod?
    + with other mechanism?
* [ ] explore PR API (comments, status, more?)
* [ ] explore checks API
* [ ] pharo: split server from demo
