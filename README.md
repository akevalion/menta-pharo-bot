> A GitHub App built with [Pharo](https://pharo.org/) to experiment with Github API and webhooks.

## How to use

The `build_all.sh ` script downloads a Pharo image and loads the code and it's dependencies. 

To start the HTTP server, you should read class comments of MeGithubApp and subclasses.

The `server/start.sh` script starts the Pharo image in headless mode. The image will start two servers: a HTTP server (3000 by default) and a VNC server (5900, the default port).
